# Clause

> **What if reasoning emerged purely from data, with zero hardcoded patterns?**

Clause is a pure data-driven reasoning engine where **all patterns are learned** from raw token sequences. No hardcoded regex. No semantic rules. Just statistical co-occurrences and graph operations.

## The Radical Idea

**Traditional NLP**: Hardcode grammar, regex patterns, semantic rules in code.

**Clause**: Start with ZERO knowledge. Learn everything from raw text via n-gram statistics. Patterns emerge from data, not from programmers.

```
Input: "Hello world"
Clause: I learned: 'world' → '' (with 0 options)

Input: "Hello friend"
Clause: I learned: 'friend' → '' (with 0 options)

Input: "Hello world"
Clause: I learned: 'world' → '' (with 0 options)

# System now knows: "hello" → ["world" (67%), "friend" (33%)]
# Markov chain learned purely from observations
```

**Every input teaches the system. Patterns emerge statistically.**

## Architecture

### What We DON'T Do

❌ No hardcoded regex patterns like `"X is a Y"`
❌ No semantic rules like "city in country"
❌ No query detection like `regex("^(what|where)")`
❌ No natural language understanding baked in

### What We DO

✅ Pure tokenization (split on whitespace)
✅ N-gram extraction (bigrams, trigrams)
✅ Statistical transition matrices
✅ SKI combinator calculus for inference
✅ Graph operations on topology
✅ 6D weight calculations
✅ Depth-limited graph walks
✅ Markov text generation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
cd terraform
terraform init

# Interactive mode
cd .. && ./loop.sh

# Or run directly
terraform apply -auto-approve -var='user_input=Hello world' -var='iteration=1'
```

Type anything. The system learns token sequences and builds transition matrices.

## How It Works

### Layer 1: Pure Tokenization
```
Input: "Hello, world!"
→ Cleaned: "hello world"
→ Tokens: ["hello", "world"]
```

No semantic understanding. Just split on whitespace.

### Layer 2: N-gram Extraction
```
Tokens: ["hello", "world"]
→ Bigrams: (hello, follows, world)
→ Store as triple in state
```

"follows" is the ONLY predicate we introduce. It means "appears before in sequence."

### Layer 3: Transition Matrices
```
After multiple inputs:
  "hello" → ["world": 0.67, "friend": 0.33]
```

Markov chain probabilities from raw observations.

### Layer 4: SKI Combinator Calculus

All inference expressed as compositions of three primitives:

- **I (Identity)**: `λx.x` - observe unchanged
- **K (Constant)**: `λx.λy.x` - filter/select
- **S (Substitution)**: `λf.λg.λx.f(x)(g(x))` - compose operations

Each inference tagged with SKI provenance:
```json
{
  "subject": "hello",
  "predicate": "hub",
  "object": "high_degree",
  "combinator": "K(degree > avg)"
}
```

### Layer 5: Graph Operations

Pure topology, no semantics:
- Adjacency matrices
- Degree distributions
- BFS/DFS up to depth 3
- Influence scores

### Layer 6: 6D Weights

Each observation has 6 properties:
1. subject (string)
2. predicate (string)
3. object (string)
4. confidence (float) - from frequency
5. count (int) - observations
6. iteration (int) - recency

**Weight formula:**
```
weight = confidence × log(count + 1) × exp(-(current_iter - iteration) × 0.01)
```

Pure math. No hardcoded meanings.

### Layer 7: Markov Generation

Response generated by sampling from learned transitions:
```hcl
next_token = weighted_sample(
  candidates = transitions[current_word],
  weights = probabilities,
  seed = iteration
)
```

## Why This Matters

### Zero Hardcoded Knowledge

The system starts knowing NOTHING. No grammar. No syntax. No semantics.

After 100 inputs, it knows:
- Which words tend to follow which
- Which nodes are central hubs
- Which sequences are frequent patterns

**All learned from data.**

### Provable Inference

Every inference has SKI provenance:
```
(hello, hub, high_degree) was inferred via K(degree > avg)
```

Verifiable. Inspectable. Auditable.

### Self-Referential State

Terraform reads its own `terraform.tfstate`:
```hcl
prev_state = jsondecode(file("terraform.tfstate"))
prev_triples = extract_from(prev_state.resources)
```

The system reasons about its own previous reasoning.

### Never Converges

Phase cycling (iteration % 4):
- 0: extraction
- 1: inference
- 2: exploration
- 3: consolidation

Never settles. Always expressing.

## Technical Details

**Implementation**: 620 lines of pure HCL (Terraform)
**Dependencies**: None (zero Python, zero JSON configs)
**Patterns**: 0 hardcoded, all learned
**State**: Self-referential terraform.tfstate
**Inference**: SKI combinator compositions
**Generation**: Markov chains

## Example Session

```bash
$ terraform apply -var='user_input=The cat sat' -var='iteration=1'
Output: I learned 3 new tokens

$ terraform apply -var='user_input=The dog sat' -var='iteration=2'
Output: I learned: 'sat' → '' (with 0 options)

$ terraform apply -var='user_input=The cat ran' -var='iteration=3'
Output: I learned: 'ran' → '' (with 0 options)

# System now knows:
#   "the" → ["cat", "dog"]
#   "cat" → ["sat", "ran"]
#   "dog" → ["sat"]

# Query learned transitions:
$ terraform output transitions
{
  total_words = 5
  total_edges = 8
  sample_transitions = {
    "the" = ["cat", "dog"]
    "cat" = ["sat", "ran"]
  }
}
```

## Philosophy

**Traditional AI**: Train on corpus, freeze weights, deploy model.
**Clause**: Continuously learn from every input, never freeze, always evolving.

**Traditional IaC**: Declare desired state once, converge.
**Clause**: State evolves recursively, never converges, stays at edge of chaos.

**Traditional NLP**: Hardcode grammar and semantics.
**Clause**: Start from zero, learn everything statistically.

✅ Pure data-driven learning
✅ Provable inference systems
✅ Self-referential computation
✅ Teaching Markov models and SKI calculus

❌ Not for production chatbots
❌ Not for real-time inference

## Why "Clause"?

**Claude** + **state** = Clause
Also: a clause is a logical statement, and a gate between iterations.

The system was built collaboratively with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), exploring what's possible when you remove ALL hardcoded knowledge and let patterns emerge purely from data.
