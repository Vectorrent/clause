# Clause

> **What if reasoning emerged purely from data, with zero hardcoded patterns?**

Clause is a pure data-driven reasoning engine where **all patterns are learned** from raw token sequences. No hardcoded regex. No semantic rules. Just statistical co-occurrences and graph operations.

## The Radical Idea

**Traditional NLP**: Hardcode grammar, regex patterns, semantic rules in code.

**Clause**: Start with ZERO knowledge. Learn everything from raw text via n-gram statistics. Patterns emerge from data, not from programmers.

```
Input: "Hello world"
Clause: I learned: 'world' → '' (with 0 options)

Input: "Hello friend"
Clause: I learned: 'friend' → '' (with 0 options)

Input: "Hello world"
Clause: I learned: 'world' → '' (with 0 options)

# System now knows: "hello" → ["world" (67%), "friend" (33%)]
# Markov chain learned purely from observations
```

**Every input teaches the system. Patterns emerge statistically.**

## Architecture

### What We DON'T Do

❌ No hardcoded regex patterns like `"X is a Y"`
❌ No semantic rules like "city in country"
❌ No query detection like `regex("^(what|where)")`
❌ No natural language understanding baked in

### What We DO

✅ Pure tokenization (split on whitespace)
✅ N-gram extraction (bigrams, trigrams)
✅ Statistical transition matrices
✅ SKI combinator calculus for inference
✅ Graph operations on topology
✅ 6D weight calculations with sparse connectivity
✅ Depth-limited graph walks
✅ Markov text generation
✅ π-based quasi-periodic phase cycling
✅ Golden angle sampling for optimal coverage
✅ Self-tracked iteration counter (fully autonomous)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
terraform init

# Interactive mode
./loop.sh

# Or run directly (iteration auto-increments!)
terraform apply -auto-approve -var='user_input=Hello world'
```

Type anything. The system learns token sequences and builds transition matrices. **Iteration counter is self-tracked** - no need to specify it!

## How It Works

### Layer 1: Pure Tokenization
```
Input: "Hello, world!"
→ Cleaned: "hello world"
→ Tokens: ["hello", "world"]
```

No semantic understanding. Just split on whitespace.

### Layer 2: N-gram Extraction
```
Tokens: ["hello", "world"]
→ Bigrams: (hello, follows, world)
→ Store as triple in state
```

"follows" is the ONLY predicate we introduce. It means "appears before in sequence."

### Layer 3: Transition Matrices
```
After multiple inputs:
  "hello" → ["world": 0.67, "friend": 0.33]
```

Markov chain probabilities from raw observations.

### Layer 4: SKI Combinator Calculus

All inference expressed as compositions of three primitives:

- **I (Identity)**: `λx.x` - observe unchanged
- **K (Constant)**: `λx.λy.x` - filter/select
- **S (Substitution)**: `λf.λg.λx.f(x)(g(x))` - compose operations

Each inference tagged with SKI provenance:
```json
{
  "subject": "hello",
  "predicate": "hub",
  "object": "high_degree",
  "combinator": "K(degree > avg)"
}
```

### Layer 5: Graph Operations

Pure topology, no semantics:
- Adjacency matrices
- Degree distributions
- BFS/DFS up to depth 3
- Influence scores

### Layer 6: 6D Weights & Sparse Connectivity

Each observation has 6 properties:
1. subject (string)
2. predicate (string)
3. object (string)
4. confidence (float) - from frequency
5. count (int) - observations
6. iteration (int) - recency

**Weight formula:**
```
weight = confidence × log(count + 1) × (1 - (current_iter - iteration) × 0.01)
```

**Sparse Connectivity**: Instead of computing full n×n distances, we use **golden angle sampling**:
```hcl
golden_angle = 2π / φ²  # ≈ 137.5°
sample_size = √n        # Balance coverage vs cost
```

Each iteration samples √n atomics using the golden angle (like sunflower seed spirals), computing pairwise distances in 6D space. Over time, this provides **quasi-uniform coverage** while keeping computation efficient.

Pure math. No hardcoded meanings.

### Layer 7: Markov Generation

Response generated by sampling from learned transitions:
```hcl
next_token = weighted_sample(
  candidates = transitions[current_word],
  weights = probabilities,
  seed = iteration
)
```

## Why This Matters

### Zero Hardcoded Knowledge

The system starts knowing NOTHING. No grammar. No syntax. No semantics.

After 100 inputs, it knows:
- Which words tend to follow which
- Which nodes are central hubs
- Which sequences are frequent patterns

**All learned from data.**

### Provable Inference

Every inference has SKI provenance:
```
(hello, hub, high_degree) was inferred via K(degree > avg)
```

Verifiable. Inspectable. Auditable.

### Self-Referential State

Terraform reads its own `terraform.tfstate`:
```hcl
prev_state = jsondecode(file("terraform.tfstate"))
prev_triples = extract_from(prev_state.resources)
```

The system reasons about its own previous reasoning.

### Never Converges

**π-based Quasi-Periodic Phase Cycling**:

Instead of simple modulo, we use π (an irrational number):
```hcl
phase_continuous = (iteration × π) - floor(iteration × π)  # [0, 1)
computation_phase = floor(iteration × π) % 4
```

Phases (0-3):
- 0: extraction
- 1: inference
- 2: exploration
- 3: consolidation

**Why π?** Because it's irrational, the system **never repeats exactly** - like planetary orbits with precession. Each cycle is similar but shifted, creating **quasi-periodic spirals** through state space.

Never settles. Always expressing. Never exactly repeats.

## Technical Details

**Implementation**: ~750 lines of pure HCL (Terraform)
**Dependencies**: None (zero Python, zero JSON configs)
**Patterns**: 0 hardcoded, all learned
**State**: Self-referential terraform.tfstate (consolidated, 2 resources)
**Inference**: SKI combinator compositions
**Generation**: Markov chains
**Phase cycling**: π-based quasi-periodic (irrational)
**Connectivity**: Sparse golden-angle sampling (√n per iteration)
**Iteration tracking**: Fully autonomous (self-incrementing)
**Plan size**: ~300-600 lines (down from 2500+ with per-atomic resources)

## Example Session

```bash
# Iteration auto-increments! No need to track it manually.
$ terraform apply -var='user_input=The cat sat'
iteration = 1
response = "Learned: [the, cat, sat] | Transitions: 2 words | Generated: \"the cat\" | Inferences: 7"

$ terraform apply -var='user_input=The dog sat'
iteration = 2
response = "Learned: [the, dog, sat] | Transitions: 3 words | Generated: \"the\" | Inferences: 9"

$ terraform apply -var='user_input=The cat ran'
iteration = 3
response = "Learned: [the, cat, ran] | Transitions: 4 words | Generated: \"cat sat\" | Inferences: 13"

# System now knows:
#   "the" → ["cat", "dog"]
#   "cat" → ["sat", "ran"]
#   "dog" → ["sat"]

# Query learned transitions:
$ terraform output transitions
{
  total_words = 5
  total_edges = 6
  sample_transitions = {
    "the" = ["cat", "dog"]
    "cat" = ["sat", "ran"]
  }
}

# Check pi-based phase cycling:
$ terraform output pi_geometry
{
  pi = 3.14159265359
  golden_ratio = 1.61803398875
  golden_angle = 2.39996...
  phase_continuous = 0.42477...  # Never repeats!
  sparse_sample_size = 2
  sparse_coverage = "33%"
}
```

## The Mathematics

**π (Pi) - Irrational Phase Cycling**:
- `phase = (iteration × π) mod 1` creates quasi-periodic orbits
- Never repeats exactly (π is irrational)
- Like planets with orbital precession
- Creates deterministic but non-repeating exploration

**φ (Golden Ratio) - Optimal Sampling**:
- `golden_angle = 2π / φ² ≈ 137.5°`
- Used in nature (sunflower spirals, pine cones)
- Provides most uniform coverage with fewest samples
- Each iteration samples √n atomics at golden-angle rotation

**6D Hypersphere**:
- Each atomic is a point in 6-dimensional space
- Sparse pairwise distances computed each iteration
- Creates fully-connected conceptual space over time
- Distance metric combines symbolic (3D) + numerical (3D) properties

**Result**: Deterministic chaos with optimal space-filling properties.

## Philosophy

**Traditional AI**: Train on corpus, freeze weights, deploy model.
**Clause**: Continuously learn from every input, never freeze, always evolving.

**Traditional IaC**: Declare desired state once, converge.
**Clause**: State evolves recursively, never converges, stays at edge of chaos.

**Traditional NLP**: Hardcode grammar and semantics.
**Clause**: Start from zero, learn everything statistically.

**Traditional iteration**: External counter, manual tracking.
**Clause**: Self-tracked time, fully autonomous.

## Why "Clause"?

**Claude** + **state** = Clause
Also: a clause is a logical statement, and a gate between iterations.

The system was built collaboratively with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), exploring what's possible when you remove ALL hardcoded knowledge and let patterns emerge purely from data.
