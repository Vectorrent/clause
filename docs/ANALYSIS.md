# Clause: Technical Analysis & Research Findings

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: Feasible and genuinely novel. No prior art exists for using IaC tools for reasoning/world modeling.

**Key Innovation**: The iterative loop with `terraform apply --auto-approve` + user gates = conversational world modeling.

---

## Core Architecture

### The Loop is the System

```
User Input → [CLAUSE/Gate] → terraform apply → State Update
                ↑                                     ↓
                └────────────[Loop Back]──────────────┘
```

**Not**: One Terraform config = entire reasoning
**Instead**: Multiple applies = iterative state evolution

### Three Components

1. **Terraform**: State manager (world model in `.tfstate`)
2. **Python/Go**: Reasoner (fact extraction, inference)
3. **Bash**: Orchestrator (loop, gates, I/O)

---

## Foundational Theory

### SKI Combinator Calculus

Minimal computational basis with three operations:
- **I** (Identity): `I x = x`
- **K** (Constant): `K x y = x`
- **S** (Substitution): `S x y z = x z (y z)`

**Why relevant**:
- Any computable function can be expressed with S, K, I
- Composable without variables
- Formal semantics (provable correctness)
- Maps to Terraform resources as reasoning primitives

**Example**:
```python
def I(x): return x
def K(x): return lambda y: x
def S(x): return lambda y: lambda z: x(z)(y(z))

# Build complex reasoning from these three primitives
```

**Connection**: Reasoning operations can be composed from combinators, represented as Terraform resources.

### Multisets

Collections where elements can appear multiple times.

**Why relevant**:
- Same fact observed N times → confidence level
- Natural representation for evidence accumulation
- Frequency → probability

**Example**:
```python
multiset = {
  "Paris is_a city": 3,      # High confidence
  "France is_a country": 1   # Lower confidence
}

confidence = count / total_observations
```

**Connection**: Terraform state accumulates observations; multiset counts derive confidence.

## Related Research

### State Machine of Thoughts (SMoT, Dec 2023)

[arXiv:2312.17445](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17445)

**Key concepts**:
- State machine records reasoning trajectories
- States = decomposed sub-problems
- Transitions = dependencies between sub-problems
- Records both successful and failed paths
- Reuses experience to avoid mistakes

**Direct mapping to Clause**:
- Terraform resources = states
- Dependencies = transitions
- State file = trajectory history
- Plan/apply = deliberate before committing

**Perfect conceptual alignment!**

### World Models (2024)

Recent AI research uses world models for:
- Predictive reasoning
- Planning
- Counterfactual analysis
- Abstract state representation (language vs. pixels)

**Relevant systems**:
- Vision-Language World Models (VLWM): Use language as abstract state
- Wayve LINGO-2: Driving with real-time world model
- OpenAI Sora: Video generation as world simulation

**Connection**: Terraform state file = symbolic world model, updated iteratively.

### Declarative AI Systems

**Prolog**: Logic programming, unification, backtracking
**Datalog**: Recursive queries over relational data
**Answer Set Programming**: Declarative problem solving

**Similarity to Clause**:
- Declarative "what is true" vs. imperative "how to compute"
- Logical inference from facts and rules
- Explicit knowledge representation

**Difference**:
- Clause uses Terraform's plan/apply for deliberation
- Git-based versioning of knowledge
- State convergence model

## Technical Feasibility

### What Works

✅ **State accumulation**: Terraform state naturally accumulates resources over iterations
✅ **Dependencies**: Express logical/temporal relationships
✅ **Plan preview**: See consequences before committing (deliberation!)
✅ **External integration**: `external` data source for Python/Go reasoning
✅ **Versioning**: Git + Terraform = version-controlled world models
✅ **Collaboration**: Remote state with locking for multi-agent

### Limitations

❌ **No learning**: Must manually engineer rules (not ML-based)
❌ **Performance**: 5-30s per iteration (fine for deliberation, bad for real-time)
❌ **Deterministic only**: No probabilistic reasoning (without workarounds)
❌ **Complexity**: Custom providers require Go expertise

### Optimal Use Cases

1. **Auditable AI** (regulatory compliance, explainable decisions)
2. **Multi-agent simulations** (shared world state with locking)
3. **Counterfactual planning** ("what if" analysis)
4. **Incremental knowledge construction** (gradual KB building)
5. **Deterministic pipelines** (research reproducibility)

### Poor Fit

- Real-time chatbots (too slow)
- Machine learning (no gradient descent)
- Probabilistic reasoning (no native uncertainty)
- Large-scale NLP (state files would be huge)

---

## Why No Prior Art?

**Search results**: Zero examples of IaC tools used for non-infrastructure purposes.

**Possible reasons**:
1. Infrastructure tools seen as too narrow/specialized
2. Performance concerns (slower than direct implementation)
3. Conceptual mismatch (infra ≠ reasoning)
4. Simply unexplored territory

**Implication**: Genuine research opportunity, high novelty value.

## Terraform Capabilities

### Custom Providers (Go)

- Full control over resource CRUD operations
- Private state for internal data
- Plugin Framework for rapid development
- Can encapsulate arbitrary logic (reasoning engines, KB queries)

### State Management

- JSON state file tracks all resources
- Remote backends (S3, GCS, etc.) for sharing
- State locking prevents concurrent modifications
- Versioning/snapshots for time-travel debugging

### Key Features for Clause

1. **`terraform_data` resource**: Store arbitrary JSON in state
2. **`external` data source**: Call Python/Go scripts
3. **`depends_on`**: Explicit dependency ordering
4. **Variables**: Parameterize configurations
5. **Outputs**: Extract results
6. **Workspaces**: Parallel reasoning contexts

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Loop (Week 1)

```bash
# loop.sh orchestrates:
while true; do
  read USER_INPUT
  echo "user_input = \"$USER_INPUT\"" > input.auto.tfvars
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  terraform output response
done
```

**Components**:
- `loop.sh`: Bash script
- `main.tf`: Terraform config with `terraform_data` resources
- `process.py`: Python script called via `external` data source

**Goal**: Conversational fact accumulation

### Phase 2: Multisets (Week 2)

Track observation counts in state:
```hcl
resource "terraform_data" "fact_multiset" {
  input = {
    multiset = jsonencode({
      "Paris is_a city": 3,
      "France is_a country": 1
    })
  }
}
```

Compute confidence from frequency.

**Goal**: Evidence-based belief confidence

### Phase 3: SKI Combinators (Week 3)

Implement reasoning as combinator composition:
```python
# In process.py
result = S(rule1)(rule2)(fact)
```

Represent in Terraform:
```hcl
resource "clause_combinator" "composed_rule" {
  type = "S"
  arg1 = clause_combinator.rule1.id
  arg2 = clause_combinator.rule2.id
}
```

**Goal**: Compositional reasoning primitives

### Phase 4: Refinement (Week 4)

- Query capability
- Inference rules
- Visualization
- Optimization

**Goal**: Usable system

---

## Performance Expectations

### Iteration Latency

- Bash overhead: ~50ms
- Terraform plan/apply: 1-5s (small state)
- Python processing: 100-500ms
- **Total**: ~2-6s per iteration

**Acceptable for**:
- Deliberative reasoning
- Human-in-the-loop conversations
- Batch processing

**Not acceptable for**:
- Real-time APIs
- Streaming responses
- Low-latency systems

### Scale Limits

- **Facts**: ~10K-100K before performance degrades
- **Iterations**: Unlimited (state accumulates)
- **Concurrent users**: ~10-50 (with state locking)

---

## Key Insights

1. **The loop IS the system**: Not a one-shot configuration, but iterative state evolution
2. **Plan = deliberation**: `terraform plan` previews reasoning before commitment
3. **State = world model**: `.tfstate` file is the knowledge representation
4. **Gate = clause**: User input between iterations is the "clause" that advances reasoning
5. **Composability**: SKI combinators enable building complex reasoning from simple primitives
6. **Evidence = multisets**: Repeated observations → confidence levels

---

## Open Questions

1. **How far can SKI combinators scale?** Can complex reasoning be practical with just S, K, I?
2. **Optimal multiset representation?** Store counts in state, or recompute from observations?
3. **State file growth?** Will it become unwieldy after 1000s of iterations?
4. **Terraform vs. custom state manager?** Is Terraform essential, or just convenient for POC?
5. **Hybrid with LLMs?** Can LLMs propose facts, Clause verifies/stores them?

**Bottom line**: This is feasible, novel, and theoretically grounded (SKI + multisets + SMoT). The loop architecture is simpler and more natural than the original one-shot design. Build Week 1, evaluate, iterate.
